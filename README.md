# Playground for Dart

Simple examples that help you get started with Appwrite + Dart (=❤️)

This is Appwrite server-side integration with Dart. For Flutter integration please look at our [Flutter playground](https://github.com/appwrite/playground-for-flutter) and [Flutter SDK](https://github.com/appwrite/sdk-for-flutter)

### Work in progress

Appwrite playground is a simple way to explore the Appwrite API and Appwrite Dart SDK. Use the source code of this page to learn how to use different Appwrite Dart SDK features.

## Get Started
This playground doesn't include any Dart best practices but rather intends to show some of the most simple examples and use cases of using the Appwrite API in your Dart application.

## System Requirements
* A Linux/Windows/Mac system with Dart or Flutter installed
* Have a readily available Appwrite running instance (localhost in most cases).
* Create a project in Appwrite instance using console
* Generate a secret key in the Appwrite instance using console

### Installation
1. Clone this repository
2. cd into the repository
3. Open main.dart file found in the root of the cloned repository
4. Copy the project_id, endpoint, and secret key from the Appwrite Console
5. Update project_id, endpoint, and secret key by copying from the console in the main.dart file
6. Execute the command `dart run main.dart`
7. You will see the JSON response in the console
